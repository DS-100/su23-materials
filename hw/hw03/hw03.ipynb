The VADER lexicon itself relies on crowdsourcing humans to stabilize its scoring. However, sentence structure and word phrasing heavily impacts sentiment, but our current approach ignores these contexts, instead opting for approximate, naive sentiments to perform initial EDA. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to further explore this direction of the data, we would consider approaches for computing tweet sentiment that are modern, nuanced, and more accurate (for some definition of \"accurate\"). Such approaches often adapt deep natural language processing models to sentiment analysis tasks, meaning they directly address the sentiment of a body of text, instead of individual words like VADER. However, these models still depend on a robust \"training dataset\" of tweet sentiments, which is often still generated through crowdsourced human work.
