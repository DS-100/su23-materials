    "## Introduction\n",
    "You will use what you've learned in class to create a binary classifier that can distinguish spam (junk or commercial or bulk) emails from ham (non-spam) emails. In addition to providing some skeleton code to fill in, we will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and your written responses in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this project, you should feel comfortable with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature engineering with text data,\n",
    "- Using `sklearn` library to process data and fit models, and\n",
    "- Validating the performance of your model and minimizing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first part of the project focuses on initial analysis as well as Feature Engineering and Logistic Regression. In the second part of this project (to be released next week),  you will build your own spam/ham classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Content Warning\n",
    "This is a **real world** dataset – the emails you are trying to classify are actual spam and legitimate emails. As a result, some of the spam emails may be in poor taste or be considered inappropriate. We think the benefit of working with realistic data outweighs these innapropriate emails, and wanted to give a warning at the beginning of the project so that you are made aware.\n",
