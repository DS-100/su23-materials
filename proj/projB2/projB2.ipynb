    "- Using `sklearn` libraries to process data and fit models,\n",

In order to get full credit on the accuracy part of this assignment, you must get at least **85%** accuracy on both the train and test set (see Q4 for the partial credit breakdown).

    "1. Finding better features based on the email text. Some example features are:\n",
    "    1. Number of characters in the subject / body\n",
    "    1. Number of words in the subject / body\n",
    "    1. Use of punctuation (e.g., how many '!'s were there?)\n",
    "    1. Number / percentage of capital letters \n",
    "    1. Whether the email is a reply to an earlier email or a forwarded email\n",
    "1. Finding better (and/or more) words to use as features. Which words are the best at distinguishing emails? This requires digging into the email text itself. \n",
    "1. Better data processing. For example, many emails contain HTML as well as text. You can consider extracting out the text from the HTML to help you find better words. Or, you can match HTML tags themselves, or even some combination of the two.\n",
    "1. Model selection. You can adjust parameters of your model (e.g. the penalty type, the regularization parameter, or any arguments in `LogisticRegression`) to achieve higher accuracy. Recall that you should use cross-validation to do feature and model selection properly! Otherwise, you will likely overfit to your training data.\n",
    "    1. We have imported `GridSearchCV` for you. You may use sklearn's `GridSearchCV` ([documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html)) class to perform cross-validation. You do not need to code your own CV from scratch, though you are welcome to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use GridSearchCV. Suppose we wanted to experiment with 3 different solvers (numerical methods for optimizing the mode) models for a LogisticRegression Model `lr_model`. \n",
    "1. We could define a dictionary specifying the hyperparameters and the specific values we want to try out like so: `parameters = {'solver':[{‘lbfgs’, ‘liblinear’, ‘newton-cg’, 'saga']}`.\n",
    "2. Running `grid = GridSearchCV(estimator=lr_model, param_grid=parameters)` would give us a model for each combination of hyperparameters we are testing - in this case, just 4 models.\n",
    "3. We fit each model to some training data `X_train` and `Y_train` like so, `grid_result = grid.fit(X_train, Y_train)`\n",
    "4. Indexing into `grid_result.cv_results_` with a particular metric (in this case, `mean_test_score`), we get an array with the scores corresponding to each of the models. `grid_result.cv_results_['mean_test_score']`.\n",
    "Feel free to experiment with other hyperparameters and metrics as well, the documentation is your friend!     \n",

In addition, **you are only allowed to train logistic regression models**. No decision trees, random forests, k-nearest-neighbors, neural nets, etc.\n",

    "In most cases we won't be able to get 0 false positives and 0 false negatives, so we have to compromise. For example, in the case of cancer screenings, false negatives are comparatively worse than false positives — a false negative means that a patient might not discover that they have cancer until it's too late, whereas a patient can just receive another screening for a false positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that logistic regression calculates the probability that an example belongs to a certain class. Then, to classify an example we say that an email is spam if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.5$ probability of being spam. However, *we can adjust that cutoff threshold*: we can say that an email is spam only if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.7$ probability of being spam, for example. This is how we can trade off false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve shows this trade off for each possible cutoff probability. In the cell below, plot a ROC curve for your final classifier (the one you use to make predictions for Gradescope) on the training data. Refer to Lecture 19 to see how to plot an ROC curve.\n",
