    "Many of you have probably heard of Bigfoot before. It's a mysterious ape-like creature that is said to live in North American forests. Most doubt its existence, but a passionate few swear that bigfoot is real. In this discussion, you will be working with a dataset on bigfoot sightings, visualizing variable distributions and combinations thereof to better understand how/when/where bigfoot is reportedly spotted, and possibly either confirm or cast doubt on its existence. The bigfoot data contains a ton of variables about each reported bigfoot spotting, including location information, weather, and moon phase."
