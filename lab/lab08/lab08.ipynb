    "Alternatively, we can plot the residuals vs. our model predictions (fitted values). This is known as the **residual plot**. Ideally they'd all be zero. Given the inevitably of noise, we would at least like them to be scatter randomly across the line where the residual is zero. By contrast, there appears to be a possible pattern with our model consistently underestimating prices for both very low and very high values, and possibly consistently overestimating prices towards the middle range below. We can figure out whether the model is overestimating or undersestimating based on the sign of the residual - if it is negative, it means $y_i < \\hat{y_i}$ so we are overestimating prices. Conversely, if the residual is positive, $y_i > \\hat{y_i}$ and we end up underestimating prices."

This allows us to use more data for training instead of having to set aside some specifically for hyperparameter selection. However, doing so requires more computation resources as we'll have to fit K models per hyperparameter choice.\n",

To select between various features, various models, or various hyperparameters, we split the training set further into multiple temporary train and validation sets (each split is called a \"fold\", hence k-fold cross validation). We will use the average validation error across all k folds to make our optimal feature, model, and hyperparameter choices. In this example, we'll only use this procedure for hyperparameter selection, specifically to choose the best lambda."
